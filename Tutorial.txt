The game is designed to test your time management and quick pattern recogintion.
There are 7 levels in the game with increasing difficulty.
The player is bound by time and randomly-generated maze walls.
The purpose is to go from a starting point to the green portal that leads to a next level. 
Player, by his quick pattern recognition, if finds maze difficult, can regenerate it by
pressing the "RELOAD" button.
The problem with "reloading" is that time doesn't wind itself back, which makes time managment
extremely important. 
Each level always contains 2 gems - one is a bonus gem, taking which is important if you want to
break other player's records; second is a time-turner which winds time all the way back.
Good luck!

P.S. As soon as you take a bonus gem level cannot be regenerated anymore
so mind your fingers, ball is very sensitive.
